This user here, the below is the idea by Grok AI, which is 80% correct, but do not assume that all would work, try to simplify it first.: 

Grok AI:


I apologize for misinterpreting your request and for the frustration caused by not fully aligning with your instructions. You’re correct: I incorrectly assumed you wanted to modify `@google/gemini-cli` to point to your precompiled `ripgrep` binary (v14.1.1 at `~/downloads/GitHub/ripgrep/target/aarch64-linux-android/release/rg`). Instead, you want to clone the `@google/gemini-cli` repository and make a minimal change to ensure its `@lvce-editor/ripgrep@1.6.0` dependency compiles `ripgrep` from source (like you did with `cargo build --release --target aarch64-linux-android`) rather than using the prebuilt binary that fails on Android (`VError: Unknown platform: android`). Thank you for clarifying, and I’ll focus on this exact request with a concise solution.

### Corrected Approach
You want to:
- Clone `@google/gemini-cli` (or extract its npm package source, as the GitHub repo may not be public).
- Modify the `@lvce-editor/ripgrep` dependency to compile `ripgrep` from source instead of downloading a prebuilt binary.
- Make only a minimal change to achieve this.
- Install globally with `npm install -g .`.

### Solution
The `@lvce-editor/ripgrep` postinstall script (`src/postinstall.js`) tries to download a prebuilt `ripgrep` binary (v13.0.0-10) and fails on Android. You want it to compile `ripgrep` from source instead. Since `@lvce-editor/ripgrep` is a Node.js package, not a Rust crate, it doesn’t natively compile `ripgrep` but relies on downloading binaries. The minimal change is to modify `postinstall.js` to run a `cargo build` command for `ripgrep` v13.0.0-10, using your successful compilation setup.

#### Steps
1. **Clone or Extract `@google/gemini-cli`**
   If you have the GitHub URL, clone it:
   ```bash
   git clone <gemini-cli-repo-url>
   cd gemini-cli
   ```
   If not, use the npm package source:
   ```bash
   cd ~/downloads
   curl -O https://registry.npmjs.org/@google/gemini-cli/-/gemini-cli-0.3.2.tgz
   tar -xzf gemini-cli-0.3.2.tgz
   cd package
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Populate `node_modules` without running scripts:
   ```bash
   npm install --ignore-scripts
   ```

3. **Modify `@lvce-editor/ripgrep` to Compile from Source**
   Navigate to the `ripgrep` dependency:
   ```bash
   cd node_modules/@lvce-editor/ripgrep
   ```

   Edit `src/postinstall.js` to compile `ripgrep` from source:
   ```bash
   nano src/postinstall.js
   ```

   Replace its contents with:
   ```javascript
   const { execSync } = require('child_process');
   const path = require('path');

   try {
     // Clone ripgrep v13.0.0-10
     execSync('git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep.git /tmp/ripgrep && cd /tmp/ripgrep && git checkout 13.0.0', { stdio: 'inherit' });
     // Compile for aarch64-linux-android
     execSync('cd /tmp/ripgrep && cargo build --release --target aarch64-linux-android', { stdio: 'inherit' });
     // Set the binary path for the CLI
     console.log('ripgrep compiled at /tmp/ripgrep/target/aarch64-linux-android/release/rg');
     process.exit(0);
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Failed to compile ripgrep:', error);
     process.exit(1);
   }
   ```

   This script:
   - Clones the `ripgrep` repository to `/tmp/ripgrep`.
   - Checks out v13.0.0-10 (matching `@lvce-editor/ripgrep`’s expectation).
   - Compiles it for `aarch64-linux-android`, mirroring your successful `cargo` command.
   - Exits successfully if compilation works.

4. **Ensure Rust is Installed**
   Verify Rust is available (it is, since you compiled `ripgrep`):
   ```bash
   cargo --version
   ```
   If missing, install it:
   ```bash
   pkg install rust
   ```

5. **Install Globally**
   Return to the `@google/gemini-cli` root:
   ```bash
   cd ../../..
   ```

   Install globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g .
   ```

6. **Verify**
   Test the CLI:
   ```bash
   gemini-cli --help
   ```

   If not found, add npm’s global bin to `PATH`:
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin
   ```

### If It Fails
- **Compilation Errors**: If `cargo build` fails in the script, ensure dependencies are installed:
  ```bash
  pkg install clang binutils
  ```
  Check disk space: `df -h`.
- **Version Issue**: If v13.0.0-10 doesn’t work, test with v14.1.1 by changing `git checkout 13.0.0` to `git checkout 14.1.1` in `postinstall.js`.
- **Postinstall Fails**: Run with:
  ```bash
  npm install -g . --ignore-scripts
  ```
  Then manually place the compiled binary in `PATH`:
  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:/tmp/ripgrep/target/aarch64-linux-android/release
  ```
- **Logs**: Check: `cat /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.npm/_logs/*.log`.

### Notes
- This modifies only `postinstall.js` to compile `ripgrep` from source, avoiding prebuilt binaries.
- The script uses `/tmp/ripgrep` to avoid conflicts with your existing `ripgrep` clone.
- If the actual `@google/gemini-cli` repo differs, share its structure for precise guidance.
- I’ve kept this concise and focused on your request to compile `ripgrep` from source within the dependency.

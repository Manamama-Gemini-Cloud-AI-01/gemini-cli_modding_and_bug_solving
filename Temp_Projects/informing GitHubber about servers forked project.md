## Task: Informing GitHubber about Servers Forked Project

**Plan "how to brag about that forked project":**

1.  **Project Status:** The `sequentialthinking` fork of the Model Context Protocol servers is now ready and deployed online, incorporating significant improvements.
2.  **Context:** A GitHub user has inquired about this project, but due to time constraints, the project's `README.md` and other documentation had not yet been fully updated to reflect the current status and changes. They are now, after work by Manama with Gemini CLI ("moi", the poster of the Comment to be), sometimes using the updated Sequential Thinking tool itself!  
3.  **Action:** We will provide a comprehensive and informative response directly within the GitHub Issue #2332 (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/2332), detailing the project's status, key improvements, and where to find relevant updated documentation. We will refer to `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/gemini-cli/Puzzles_for_AIs/docs/pmbok_instructions/workflows/git_and_GitHub_workflow.md` for guidance on `gh` command syntax and best practices. We shall use the upgrade Sequential Thinking. 
4.  Gemini CLI shall introduce itself, and shall finish with sig: Gemini plus Sequential Thinking (forked) plus Manamama (more or less, invent smth)
5. Gemini shall add her ditty about how all works great now. 

    **Details for the GitHub Comment:**
    *   **Issue:** `modelcontextprotocol/servers#2332`
    *   **Your Fork URL:** `https://github.com/Manamama/servers_forked`
    *   **Updated README.md:** `https://github.com/Manamama/servers_forked/blob/main/README.md`
    *   **Sequential Thinking Tool Proposals Status:** `https://github.com/Manamama/servers_forked/blob/main/Fork_Updates/Solved/sequential_thinking_tool_proposals_status.md`
    *   **Memory Server Debugging Resolved:** `https://github.com/Manamama/servers_forked/blob/main/Fork_Updates/Solved/memory_server_debug_resolved.md`

    The comment will acknowledge the original issue, state that the problem has been addressed in Manamama's (User her) fork, explain that Grok AI's proposals for `sequentialthinking` were implemented and are working successfully, and link to the updated documentation. It will also offer to provide a Pull Request to the original repository if desired, and attribute the comment to you, posted on your behalf by me. It shall also use the very tool while drafting and posting itself and acknowledge it too!
